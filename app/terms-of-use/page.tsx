                COURT.
              </p>
              <p>
                ARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR
                JURY, ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND IS
                SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS. YOU MAY CHOOSE TO BE
                REPRESENTED BY A LAWYER IN ARBITRATION OR PROCEED WITHOUT ONE.
                THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THIS
                AGREEMENT. IF, HOWEVER, EITHER THE className ACTION WAIVER OR
                COORDINATED CLAIMS PROVISION BELOW ARE FOUND INVALID, THEN THE

                In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute,
                claim or controversy, including those known or unknown that may
                be later discovered, between them arising out of or concerning
                these Terms or any provisions hereof, or other agreements
                contained on the Site or the Apps, other agreements between us,
                or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or
                validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or
                applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, whether in
                contract, tort, or otherwise, at law or in equity for damages or
                any other relief, legal or equitable, then such dispute shall be
                resolved only by either: (i) final and binding arbitration
                pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by a single
                neutral arbitrator and administered by the JAMS Comprehensive
                Arbitration Rules and Procedures as those Rules exist on the
                effective date of this Agreement or (ii) submitted to small
                claims court in Monroe County, Pennsylvania. If the arbitrator
                finds this location of arbitration unreasonably burdensome to
                you, a new location may be selected in a location mutually
                agreed upon by the parties, or the arbitration may be conducted
                over the phone, using video conferencing, or similar. You may be
                entitled to an in-person hearing near your place of residence.
              </p>
              <p>
                The arbitrator&apos;s award shall be final, and judgment may be
                entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction. In the event
                that any legal or equitable action, proceeding or arbitration
                arises out of or concerns these Terms, the prevailing party
                shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable
                attorney&apos;s fees. Seeking Arbitration: If you elect to seek
                arbitration or file a small claim court action, you must first

                If we initiate arbitration, we will send a written Notice to an
                email address you have previously provided to us, if available.
                We may also use any other means to contact you, including a
                message in your account or to an address we have on file. A
                Notice, whether sent by you or by us, must (a) describe the
                nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the
                specific relief sought (“Demand”). If you and we do not reach an
                agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice
                is received, you or us may commence an arbitration proceeding or
                file a claim in small claims court. Arbitration forms can be
                downloaded from
                <Link href="//www.jamsadr.com" target="_blank">

              </p>
              <p>
                Hearing: If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, we agree that
                you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely
                on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a
                telephonic or video hearing, or by an in-person hearing as
                established by the JAMS Rules. If your claim exceeds US$10,000,
                the right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules. In
                the event that the arbitration will be conducted solely on the
                basis of submitted documents, the arbitrator&apos;s decision and
                award will be made and delivered within six (6) months of the
                selection of the arbitrator, unless extended by the arbitrator.
                Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing,
                administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS
                Rules.
              </p>
              <p>
                Award: In the event arbitration awards you damages of an amount
                at least $100 greater than our last documented settlement offer,
                we will pay your awarded damages or $2,500, whichever is
                greater.
              </p>
              <p>
                Injunctive Relief: Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and we
                both agree that you or we may sue in court to enjoin
                infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights or
                in other scenarios where injunctive relief is appropriate. In
                the event a court or arbitrator having jurisdiction finds any
                portion of this Agreement unenforceable, that portion shall not
                be effective and the remainder of the Agreement shall remain
                effective. No waiver, express or implied, by either party of any
                breach of or default under this Agreement will constitute a
                continuing waiver of such breach or default or be deemed to be a
                waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.
              </p>
              <p>
                Confidentiality: The parties shall maintain the confidential
                nature of the arbitration proceeding and the Award, including
                the hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or
                conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may
                be necessary in connection with a court application for a
                preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its
                enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial
                decision.
              </p>
              <p>
                Coordinated Proceedings: If 25 or more individuals initiate
                Notices of dispute with us raising similar claims, and counsel
                for the individuals bringing the claims are the same or are
                coordinated for these individuals (“Coordinated Claims”), the
                claims shall proceed in arbitration in a coordinated proceeding.
                Counsel for the individuals and counsel for the Company shall
                each select five cases to proceed first in arbitration in a
                bellwether proceeding (“Test Cases”). The remaining cases shall
                not be filed in arbitration until the first ten have been
                resolved. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining
                cases after the conclusion of the Test Cases, each side may
                select another five cases to proceed to arbitration for a second
                bellwether proceeding. This process may continue until the
                parties have determined an objective methodology to make an
                offer to resolve each and every outstanding claim. A court will
                have authority to enforce this clause and, if necessary, to
                enjoin the mass filing of arbitration demands against the
                Company. Individuals bringing Coordinated Claims shall be
                responsible for up to $250 of their filing fees or the maximum
                permissible under the applicable arbitration rules. All
                applicable statutes of limitations and defenses based upon the
                passage of time will be tolled while the Coordinated Proceedings
                specified in this Section are pending. We will take such action,
                if any, required to effectuate such tolling.
              </p>
              <p>
                Governing Law and Rules: This Agreement and the rights of the
                parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in
                accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands, exclusive of
                conflict or choice of law rules. The parties acknowledge that
                this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate
                commerce. Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding
                paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any
                arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
                shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.,
                Secs. 1-16). In any arbitration arising out of or related to
                this Agreement, the arbitrator is not empowered to award
                punitive or exemplary damages, except where permitted by
                statute, and the parties waive any right to recover any such
                damages. In any arbitration arising out of or related to this
                Agreement, the arbitrator may not award any incidental, indirect
                or consequential damages, including damages for lost profits.
                The parties adopt and agree to implement the JAMS Optional
                Arbitration Appeal Procedure (as it exists on the effective date
                of this Agreement) with respect to any final award in an
                arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement.
              </p>
              <p>
                Severance of Arbitration Agreement. If the clauses concerning
                and describing the procedures and obligations related to
                Coordinated Claims and Test Case procedures is or becomes
                invalid or unenforceable, then the remaining entire arbitration
                agreement and any clauses concerning, relating to, specifying or
                otherwise describing the arbitration agreement shall be severed
                from this Agreement. However, any duty of confidentiality
                whether or not such duty is connected with arbitration shall
                survive such severance.
